    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If your iPad wears a screen protector like mine used to, I suggest you rip it off right now. I took the film off three days ago, and the screen has become <em>way more gorgeous</em> than what I had been looking at for an entire summer -- the peerless retina display is finally rescued from being completely obscured. And the screen feels much more smooth and sleek too!</p>

<p>Four months ago, before I even began using my new iPad, I installed a matte screen protector because I hate scratches. I still do, but I've just learned that the iPad screen itself is in fact <a href="http://www.joachim-scholz.com/academipad/2012/03/02/ipad-accessories-not-buy-screen-protectors/">highly scratch resistant</a>. If used at home, the screen is unlikely to be threatened at all. However, if often carried around in a bag like mine is, it could use some protection. Smart cover is an option, but I don't enjoy holding the device with extraneous plastic. So I got <a href="http://instagr.am/p/PmgqG3t0Rq/">a stylish case</a> from <a href="http://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=13001145027">SkinAt</a>.</p>

<p>I'm so happy with the discovery and the change.</p>
