      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/blog/2013/04/grad-application-reflections/">Grad Application Reflections</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks ago I accepted the offer of admission to <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/education/masters">Stanford&#8217;s MSCS program</a>, which concludes my graduate school application process. I&#8217;d like to record some key reflections that I have on this process. The following is based on my experience of applying for Master programs in CS / HCI, but should apply to applications for other degree programs as well.</p>

<p>Rule #1 for fellow Chinese applicants: <em>no agencies whatsoever</em>. I know you probably heard this from everyone, but I&#8217;d say it again. If you want to get in a good program, get your own hands dirty, and don&#8217;t depend on others. Yes, going through the entire application process can be excruciating, but it&#8217;s worth it.</p>

<p>Really know what you want from grad school, and build up your profile and application package accordingly to support your purpose. I&#8217;m a big believer of going for what you love, and grad application is no different. If you know exactly why you want to study in a program, you probably have a much better chance than many of your competitors. I&#8217;ve seen people who don&#8217;t have a dream school. I&#8217;ve seen people who apply for a program because everyone else does (they aren&#8217;t even motivated enough to read the program&#8217;s admission FAQ). I&#8217;ve seen people who choose to study abroad because their parents tell them to. How can they convince the admission committee that they are motivated to succeed in the program? How can they possibly tell good stories in the Statement of Purpose?</p>

<p>Research your target programs. Are their any interesting faculty that you might want to work with? What tracks / courses do they offer that interest you? Anything about the university / department / location that attracts you in particular? Again, know what you want from each of your chosen programs (though your rationales are probably similar to one another), and make it clear in your application materials.</p>

<p>Spend solid time on your essays. Vince Gotera <a href="http://www.uni.edu/~gotera/gradapp/stmtpurpose.htm">said</a>, &#8220;The Statement of Purpose required by grad schools is probably the hardest thing you will ever write.&#8221; I kind of agree. Nobody is born knowing how to compose good grad school essays. Before you start to prepare the essay, read what others say about it (you can find <em>a lot</em> online). When you are happy with your draft, ask people to read it, especially experienced people. If you are able to find good hands, you don&#8217;t need to ask too many people, because one sophisticated reviewer can be more helpful than ten novices. Based on my experience, two types of people might be good helpers here: (successful) former applicants, and professionals who help students apply. I was fortunate to receive help from both these kinds of people: my girlfriend Ivy who got into Stanford Graduate School of Education last year, and Joanne who has many years of experience helping people apply for college. Though undergrad application is quite different from grad application, Joanne&#8217;s expertise of SoP critique made a tremendous difference to many aspects of my essay. Now you have the feedback, revise, even rewrite. I made three major revisions before I finally got my SoP in good shape.</p>

<p>These are what I have in mind for now. Graduate school application is really all about how much you <em>want</em> to get in your dream program. If you <em>really</em> want it (and, of course, work really hard for it), chances are that you&#8217;ll eventually get it. Where there is a will, there is a way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend marked <a href="http://scottcheng.github.com/d3js-101/">the first long technical talk</a> of my life. I spoke about <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Grid_Corporation_of_China">State Grid</a>, a global Fortune 500 company (in fact it <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2012/snapshots/10840.html">ranked 7 in 2012</a>).
If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve taken away from this first time experience, it&#8217;s that I learned just how much fun speaking can be.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A good blogging system must support users to easily start composing and publishing from multiple devices. However, the Octopress website only teaches <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">how to create a fresh blog</a>, but talks nothing about setting up an existing blog on a fresh computer. This operation turned out to be somewhat confusing to me, and obviously I&#8217;m <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/755">not alone on this</a>. So here I record the process, partly for my later reference, partly in hope to help others.</p>

<p>Here is a context: I&#8217;m using GitHub user pages (<a href="http://scottcheng.github.com/">scottcheng.github.com</a>) to host my Octopress blog, so this walk-through may or may not apply to your case. It shouldn&#8217;t be too far off, though.</p>

<ol>
<li>Clone your old blog repo with all your previous posts in it (instead of <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">a fresh Octopress repo</a>).</li>
<li>Unless you changed the repo&#8217;s default branch, you now have the master branch containing the static site. In this case, use <code>git checkout source</code> to grab the source files.</li>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Install the dependencies</a> if you haven&#8217;t yet.</li>
<li>Run <code><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">rake setup_github_pages</a></code>, and Octopress will point your generated site (in _deploy folder) to the master branch &#8211; you can deploy now.</li>
<li>Remove master branch locally with <code>git branch -d master</code>. Otherwise, every time you do <code>git push</code>, git will alert conflicts on the master branch.

<ul>
<li>Alternative 1: <code>git push origin source</code> all the time.</li>
<li>Alternative 2: use <code><a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config">git config</a> push.default current</code> to only push the current branch (i.e. source branch) by default in <code>git push</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start blogging!</li>
</ol>


<p>Be a happy owner of your new machine, and don&#8217;t let Octopress get in the way ;)</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I got an unexpected opportunity to interview some applicants for <a href="http://www.beijing3ds.org/">a startup event</a>. It was a unique experience that gave me a fresh perspective, and I&#8217;d like to share some of my discoveries as a first time interviewer (may sound extremely naive and stupid to you :p).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An applicant might expect the interviewer to be familiar with everything in his application packet. I suppose I totally should, if I want to be a nice interviewer, but the fact is that I&#8217;m simply not able to bring back all the details of the guy sitting in front of me right after the previous one had left, when I have to talk to 6 applicants back-to-back in an hour. Point is, if there is something important in your materials that you think would significantly increase your chance, be sure to bring it up and remind the interviewer of it &#8211; he might miss it otherwise!</p></li>
<li><p>As recruiters, all we really care about is whether an applicant <em>fits</em> the position. In other words, whether you&#8217;ll excel at the job, and whether you&#8217;ll be happy doing it. Some folks in my pool appeared very sophisticated at what they do, but failed to demonstrate the skills and qualities that we were looking for, so we had to reject them. Also, it&#8217;s totally cool to have hobbies (music, sports, etc), and I&#8217;ll think of you as an interesting person, but it doesn&#8217;t make up for your aptitude (if you lack it), and doesn&#8217;t have much to do with your chance of getting in.</p></li>
<li><p>Passion and motivation can be very appealing, and it&#8217;s quite easy to tell whether they are genuine or not.</p></li>
<li><p>For the inexperienced: proficiency matters. It&#8217;s definitely important to be a fast learner, but relevant experiences tend to be more impressive. Of course there has to be a first step to any new field in life, in which case it helps if you have taken the initiative and got some preliminary experience or research on your own, which also reflects motivation.</p></li>
</ol>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/blog/2012/10/waterfall-and-footnote/">Waterfall and Footnote</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Popularized by <a href="http://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, waterfall layout is a smart invention because it could elegantly take up the entire window with flexible positioning. By default, waterfall doesn&#8217;t paginate; instead, &#8220;pages&#8221; are automatically loaded and appended as a user reaches the bottom of the page, providing a non-stop browsing experience, which, in itself, is nice.</p>

<p>So people start to mock it, as they always would, and some of these implementations left a page footer there, right below the waterfall. Predictably, the poor footer gets constantly &#8220;flushed&#8221; downwards every time I try to have a good look at it, and I can <em>never</em> reach it. (Here is a workaround: disconnect the Internet and the page will stop growing)</p>

<p>If some part of a webpage can never be read and clicked on under reasonably good network condition, what is the point of it being there at all? It gets especially annoying if that part is somewhat intriguing that people want to interact with.</p>

<p>I totally understand that footer is a default web element, but please think twice before going with traditions, especially when trying out something unprecedented. Don&#8217;t take rules for granted &#8211; they may be flawed, even fallacious. Think about why things are the way they are, and how they can be tweaked or redesigned to better fit a specific case. Question authorities; question everything.</p>

<p>This is my little complaint after 20 seconds of unsuccessful attempts to catch the contacts in the footer of <a href="http://www.meishimeike.com/">Meishimeike</a>.</p>
