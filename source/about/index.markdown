Hello there, my name is Scott Cheng / 程烨. I'm currently a [CS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) undergraduate at [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/), and I'll most probably continue my graduate study in the United States.

I'm passionate about technology in general, and I'm particularly fanatical about user experience and web design & development. I want to create things that people love, things that make the world a better place.

I _love_ music, cannot live without it. I listen to lots of different genres. Here is a [long list](http://www.xiami.com/space/lib-artist/u/1920321/page/1?mode=block) of artists that I follow, among which [X Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Japan), [Jason Mraz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Mraz), [Coldplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay), [Muse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_\(band\)), [東京事変(Tokyo Incidents)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Jihen), [林宥嘉(Yoga)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Lin) are some of my favorites. I sing sometimes (as a hobby), and I go to [karaoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke) with friends. I used to spend a lot of time playing the [Electone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electone) as a little boy (I was top 5 nationwide!), but now I only occasionally play the [Piano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano). Besides, I've always wanted to learn to play [guitar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar) and [drums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit).

I also love various [competitive sports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition#Competitive_sports): [tennis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis), [squash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_\(sport\)), [soccer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football), [floorball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floorball) and [slow-pitch softball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball). I play sometimes, but I'm no pro.

I have some other hobbies, such as photography and travel. [Check out my pictures on Instagram](http://luxogram.co/profile/scottcheng) taken by my Xperia S, which almost took the place of my old Sony alpha 330.
