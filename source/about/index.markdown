Hello there, my name is 程烨 (CHENG Ye). Call me Scott.

I'm a technology enthusiast, a design lover, and a [CS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) undergraduate at [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/). I enjoy crafting stuffs that people love.

I believe that skills are cheap; passion and taste make all the difference.

<!-- Music
---

I cannot live without music. I'm quite open to different genres -- they are beautiful to me in different ways. Here is a [long list](http://www.xiami.com/space/lib-artist/u/1920321/page/1?mode=block) of artists that I follow, among which [X Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Japan), [Jason Mraz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Mraz), [Coldplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay), [Muse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_\(band\)), [東京事変 (Tokyo Incidents)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Jihen), [林宥嘉 (Yoga)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Lin) are some of my favorites.

I sing sometimes (as a hobby), and I go to [karaoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke) with friends. I used to spend a lot of time on the [Electone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electone) as a little boy (I was top 5 nationwide!), but now I only occasionally play the [Piano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano). Besides, I've always wanted to learn [guitar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar) and [drums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit).

Sports
---

I also love various [competitive sports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition#Competitive_sports): [tennis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis), [squash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_\(sport\)), [soccer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football), [floorball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floorball) and [slow-pitch softball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball). I play sometimes, but I'm no pro. -->
