I remember the first time the four of us (one quit shortly afterwards) gathered in the conference room on the seventh floor, discussing how we should set off this project -- they all chose the back-end modules, leaving me with the user interface. That's how my UX career kicked off. In retrospect, I learned so much about UI and UX theories through this project, by investigating myriads of websites and apps, and reading books like _Don't Make Me Think_ and _Non-Designer's Design Book_.
