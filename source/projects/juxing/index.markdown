I used to be a member of 文化部 (the Culture Department of Peking University Student Union) during my first year in the beautiful campus of Peking University. We hold an annual drama competition called 剧星风采大赛 (Juxing, Peking University Drama Competition, literal translation would be "drama star"), one of the most popular and prestigious competitions in Peking University. There I designed a number of publicity graphics for this affectionable competition.

  <div style="clear:both;display:block"></div>

I introduced the design concept of "star of words" to this "Drama Star" feast.

## Exhibition Board

This was printed on a huge exhibition board (8\*2.8 meters, or 26\*9 feet) at 三角地, center of Peking University.

## Roll-up Banner

## BBS Entry Art

Prior to the star design, I mainly used the concept of stage curtain.
